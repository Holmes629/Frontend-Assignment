# React Metric and Log Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository houses a React application that acts as a dynamic dashboard to visualize metrics and logs. The application features an interface that toggles between two primary tabs â€“ one for displaying metric charts and the other for viewing logs.

## Features

- **Tab Selection**: Users can switch between the Metrics and Logs tabs to view the corresponding data.
- **Dynamic Charting**: The application uses `react-chartjs-2` to render live charts for CPU Usage, Network Usage, Memory Usage, and Disk IOPS with real-time data.
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Uses simulated API functions (`MimicMetrics` and `MimicLogs`) to fetch and display time-based metrics data and application logs.
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures the interface adjusts elegantly across different screen sizes.
